# Curious Bird Bot

Hi! Curious bird bot is... well... a telegram bot made in python that use data from http://ebird.org/ .

The data was scrapped using the module scrappybird en this [direction](https://github.com/isaac152/scrappybird).

The folder json doesnt have any data, so you can scrape and select the data you want. 

Also the bot is hosted in heroku with the free plan so if doesn't work please let me know. Hope you enjoy this as much i did writing it
