# Curious Bird Bot

Hi! Curious bird bot is... well... a telegram bot made in python that uses data from http://ebird.org/ .

The data was scrapped using the module scrappybird in this [direction](https://github.com/isaac152/scrappybird).

The folder json doesn't have any data, so you can scrape and select the data you want. 

Also the bot is hosted in heroku with the free plan so if it doesn't work please let me know. Hope you enjoy this as much as i did writing it
